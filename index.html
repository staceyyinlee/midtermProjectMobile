				<h2>HISTORY </h2>
				<p>In the 1870s many of the early residents of Chinatown came from the western U.S. when the anti-Chinese riots occurred in 1877 San Francisco. Some of these people participated in the California Gold Rush or helped construct the 1st transcontinental railroad. </p>
				<p>By the 1880s Chinatown had grown and was filled with restaurants, laundries, and small shops. But, when Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, immigration was halted to 10 people a year and the expansion abruptly halted.</p>
				<p>The Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed by the Magnuson Act of 1943 and Chinese immigrants were allowed to enter the country legally, but their right to own property and establish businesses was still restricted. It wouldnâ€™t be until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 that Chinese citizens and immigrants were granted full rights, and Chinatown expanded again.</p>

		<h2>PRESENT DAY ISSUES</h2>
		<p>Impact of COVID-19: From 2019 to 2021, Chinatown lost 57% of
food services jobs (compared to 45% citywide) and 28% of retail jobs (compared to 18% citywide) </p>
<p>Anti-Asian Hate: 9,081 reports of anti-Asian incidents in the U.S. received from March 19, 2020 to June 2021. </p>
<p>Lack of Aid During COVID-19: Chinatown businesses received $5.6K per job
vs. $7.8K per job citywide </p>
<p>Rising Costs and Thinning Margins: Operating costs are increasing rapidly, including rent, labor, and supply costs. Yet many Chinatown businesses feel unable to raise prices due to consumer expectations of affordability and some low-income customers </p>
